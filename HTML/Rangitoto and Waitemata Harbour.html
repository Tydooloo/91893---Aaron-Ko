            <h2>Rangitoto Island</h2>
            <div class="RangitotoIntro">Rangitoto Island is a volcanic island in 
                the Hauraki Gulf. The 5.5 km (3.4 mi) wide island is a symmetrical
                 shield volcano cone, reaching a height of 260 m (850 ft).
                 Rangitoto is the youngest and largest of the approximately
                  50 volcanoes of the Auckland volcanic field, having formed 
                  in an eruption about 600 years ago, and covering an area of
                   2,311 ha (5,710 acres). It is separated from the mainland
                    of Auckland's North Shore by the Rangitoto Channel.
                     Since World War II, it has been linked by a causeway
                      to the much older, non-volcanic Motutapu Island. 
                     Rangitoto is Māori for 'Bloody Sky', with the name
                coming from the full phrase Ngā Rangi-i-totongia-a
                 Tama-te-kapua ("The days of the bleeding of Tama-te-kapua"). 
                 Tama-te-kapua was the captain of the Arawa waka (canoe) and was badly 
                 wounded on the island, after having lost a battle with the Tainui iwi 
                 (tribe) at Islington Bay.

                <div class="MaoriAssociationTask">The volcano erupted within the historical memory of the local Māori iwi (tribes). 
                    Human footprints have been found between layers of Rangitoto volcanic ash on the adjoining 
                    Motutapu Island. Ngāi Tai was the iwi living on Motutapu, and considers both islands their 
                    ancestral home. Ngāti Paoa also has links with Rangitoto. </div>

                <h2>Geology</h2>
                <div class="Geology1">Rangitoto was formed during a single phase of eruptions that may have lasted only 5–10 years, 
                    about 600 years ago. Previous inferences that it was formed by a series of eruptions commencing 
                    at least 6000 years ago[7] have been disproved by the most recent research. The first part of
                     the eruption was wet and produced surges of volcanic ash that mantles neighbouring Motutapu Island.
                    The later part of the eruption was dry and built most of Rangitoto, erupting all the lava flows
                    and scoria cones at the apex. The 2.3 km3 (0.55 cu mi) of material that erupted from the volcano 
                    was about equal to the combined mass produced by all the previous eruptions in the Auckland volcanic
                     field, which were spread over more than 200,000 years. </div>

            <div class="ThirdBackground">
                <div class="Geology2">In 2013, scientists from Auckland University said new studies 
                    showed Rangitoto had been much more active in the past than 
                    previously thought, suggesting it had been active on and off
                     for around 1000 years before the final eruptions around 550
                      years ago (BP= before 1950). In February 2014 a 150 m 
                      (490 ft) deep hole was drilled through the western flank 
                      of Rangitoto. The same group of university scientists
                       declared that it revealed a long history of spasmodic 
                       eruptions going back at least 6000 years, although the 
                       bulk of activity post-dated 650 years. Civil Defence 
                       officials said the discovery did not make living in
                        Auckland any more dangerous, but did change their view of 
                        how an eruption might proceed. These headline-grabbing
                         results have been controversial and not accepted by all 
                         geologists. n 2018, most of the original group of 
                         Auckland University geologists reported on their latest 
                         research and reinterpretation of the drillhole sequence
                          and pronounced that the island did not erupt off and on
                          prior to its major eruption about 600 years ago and is
                           not a unique polygenetic volcano in the monogenetic 
                        Auckland volcanic field, as they had previously inferred. 
                        While it is possible that Rangitoto buried one or more smaller
                         volcanoes, to date there is no strong evidence to support this
                          idea.  <br><br>

                    Subsidence back down the throat during the cooling process 
                    has left a moat-like ring around the crater summit, which may 
                    be viewed from a path which goes right round the rim and up
                     to the highest point. In some parts of the island, fields
                      of clinker-like black lava stones are exposed, appearing
                       very recent to a casual eye. About 200 metres from the top 
                       of the mountain on the eastern side visitors can walk 
                       through some of about seven known lava tubes — tubes left
                        behind after the passage of liquid lava. The more 
                        accessible of the caves are signposted. Lava tubes are 
                        formed when low-viscosity molten lava known as pahoehoe 
                        flows and cools on the outside due to contact with the
                         ground and air, to form a hard crust allowing the 
                         still-liquid molten lava to continue to flow through 
                         inside. At Rangitoto the large tubes are cave-like. A 
                         torch is needed to explore the caves. The longest known 
                         cave is about 50 m long. </div>

            <div class="WaitemataText">Waitematā Harbour is the main access by sea to Auckland. For this reason 
                it is often referred to as Auckland Harbour, despite the fact that it is one 
                of two harbours adjoining the city. The harbour forms the northern and eastern
                 coasts of the Auckland isthmus and is crossed by the Auckland Harbour Bridge. It is matched on the southern side of the city by the shallower waters of the Manukau Harbour. 
                With an area of 70 square miles (180 km2), it connects the city's main port 
                and the Auckland waterfront to the Hauraki Gulf and the Pacific Ocean. It is 
                sheltered from Pacific storms by Auckland's North Shore, Rangitoto Island,
                 and Waiheke Island. </div>
            
            <div class="FourthBackground">
                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <div class="Etymology">The oldest Māori name of the harbour was Te
                     Whanga-nui o Toi (The Big Bay of Toi), named after Toi, an early Māori explorer.  
                    The name Waitematā means "Te Mata Waters", which according to some traditions refers
                     to a mauri stone (a stone of Māori religious significance) called Te Mata, which
                      was placed on Boat Rock (in the harbour south-west of Chatswood) by Te Arawa
                       chief Kahumatamomoe. A popular translation of Waitematā is "The Obsidian 
                      Waters", referring to obsidian rock (matā). Another popular translation,
                       derived from this, is "The Sparkling Waters", as the harbour waters were 
                       said to glint like the volcanic glass obsidian. However, this is incorrect,
                        as grammatically Waitematā could not mean this.   </div>
