        <h2>Lake Pupuke </h2>
        <div id="RangitotoIntro">
            Lake Pupuke, traditionally known in Māori as Pupukemoana, is a heart-shaped freshwater 
            lake occupying a volcanic crater (or maar) situated to the east of Westlake Boys High School. 
            The heart shape is a result of its formation by the linking of two circular craters - a 
            larger one forming most of the lake and a smaller one forming the arm in the northeast. 
            Separated from the sea by less than 200 m at one point, it has a circumference of about 
            4.5 km and reaches 57m in depth. It is popular for recreational activities and the 
            lakefront property around it.

            <h2>Māori Legend</h2>
            <div class="MaoriAssociationTask">
                A traditional Māori legend surrounding the lake tells of a tupua couple, children of the 
                fire gods. After quarreling and cursing Mahuika, the fire-goddess, their home on the 
                mainland was destroyed by Matahoe, god of earthquakes and eruptions, on Mahuika's behalf. 
                Lake Pupuke resulted from the destruction, while Rangitoto Island rose from the sea as 
                their exile. The mists surrounding Rangitoto at certain times are considered the tears 
                of the tupua couple for their former home.

            <h2>Geology</h2>
            <div class="Geology">
                Other similar craters in the Auckland volcanic field were either buried by later eruptions 
                or breached by erosion as rainwater collected and overflowed the edge of the crater. 
                Lake Pupuke remains a lake because, unlike the other vents, its eruptions produced 
                substantial lava flows; water can thus escape through cracks in the lava reaching 
                under the crater wall, creating a series of freshwater springs along the beaches 
                between Takapuna and Milford. The lava flow at the end of Takapuna Beach enveloped 
                a kauri forest, producing an internationally significant collection of tree moulds, 
                which has been called "New Zealand’s only example of a fossil forest preserved in a lava 
                flow" and which "ranks among the best examples in the world." Some moulds have escaped 
                burial by the boat ramp and car park built on top of the lava and can be viewed at low tide.

            <div class="HumanUseText">
                Close to the Takapuna city centre, the lake is popular not only with wild birds (such as shags) 
                but with picnickers, paddlers, kayakers, rowers, yachtsmen, divers, and windsurfers (lessons 
                have been given on the lake). Free divers (no tanks) have practiced in the lake. College 
                rowing crews use it. There have been boating races, and the Pupuke Boating Club operates there. 
                Takapuna Boating Club hosts regattas. The Auckland Dragon Boat Association runs an annual 
                regionals race event on the lake, with 200m, 500m, and 2 km races. The lake is the venue for 
                Dragon Boat, Canoe sprints, Canoe marathon, and Waka Ama sprint racing within the Canoe 
                Competition at the World Masters Games 2017 held in Auckland. 
                Lake Pupuke is suitable for swimming but is murky and contains thick vegetation, and 
                there have been drownings. The lake has been tested for bacteria and generally meets 
                safe swimming conditions. <b><a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-06-firepits-gods-ancient-memories-maar.html" target="_blank" alt = "Link with more information">More info</a> </b>

            Ngāti Pāoa is a Māori iwi of the Hauraki region. Its traditional lands stretch from the western 
            side of the Hauraki Plains to Auckland. They also settled on Hauraki Gulf islands such as 
            Waiheke. <br>
            Ngāti Pāoa is one of five tribes of the Marutūāhu confederation, the others being Ngāti Maru, 
            Ngāti Rongoū, Ngāti Tamaterā, and Ngāti Whanaunga. The Marutūāhu tribes are all descended 
            from Marutūāhu, a son of Hotunui, who is said to have arrived in New Zealand on the Tainui canoe. 
            The Marutūāhu tribes are therefore part of the Tainui group of tribes. The Marutūāhu confederation 
            is also part of the Hauraki collective of tribes.

            <div class="HistoryText1">
                Ngāti Pāoa is descended from Pāoa. According to a Hauraki tradition his father was 
                Rongo-tiu-moe-whara of the East Coast iwi, Ngāti Kahungunu, born at Whai-a-pāoa near 
                Wharekahika. According to Tainui accounts, his father was Hekemaru, his paternal 
                grandparents were Pikiao from the Te Arawa tribe, and Rereiao, a high-born Waikato woman 
                descended from Whatihua, and he was the brother of Mahuta, from whom Ngāti Mahuta is 
                descended. On either version, Pāoa lived with his first wife Tauhākari, sons Toapoto and 
                Toawhana, and daughter Koura at Kaitotehe, near Taupiri in the central Waikato. 
                Pāoa moved from Kaitotehe to Hauraki, where he married Tukutuku, a granddaughter of 
                Tamaterā, with whom he had sons, first Haora Tipa Koinaki and second Horowhenua.

            <div class="HistoryText2">
                Pāoa and Tukutuku's children lived in and around the Hauraki Plains. Ngāti Pāoa later spread 
                to the western side of the Firth of Thames, from where they also frequented the Hunua 
                Ranges. By the 1700s, they also frequented the Tāmaki (Auckland) isthmus, the North Shore, 
                and the eastern and northern Coromandel Peninsula.

            <div class="HistoryText3">
                In about 1780, Ngāti Pāoa established settlements along the western side of the Tamaki 
                River and at Mokoia (present-day Panmure). In 1790 and from 1793 to 1798, they engaged 
                in many battles with tribes to the north, at least as far as the Mahurangi district. 
                By 1805, they were tiring of war and negotiated peace settlements with many neighbouring 
                tribes. At this time they had settlements along the Tamaki River as far as Otahuhu.
